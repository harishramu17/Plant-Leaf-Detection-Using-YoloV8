# Plant-Leaf-Detection-Using-YoloV8

<h1>Introduction</h1>
This project aims to develop an efficient and accurate plant leaf disease detection system using YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection model. The primary objective is to detect diseases in plant leaves early on, enabling timely interventions and preventing extensive damage to crops. The YOLOv8 model is a powerful tool for real-time object detection, making it suitable for monitoring large agricultural areas.
